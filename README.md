## Inspiration

Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, more than 264 million people of all ages suffer from depression. Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. Depression can lead to suicide.

Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, between 76% and 85% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment for their disorder. Barriers to effective care include a lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders. The burden of depression and other mental health conditions is on the rise globally.

Today, approximately 5% of male youth and 12% of female youth, age 12 to 19, have experienced a major depressive episode. By age 40, about 50% of the population will have or have had a mental illness.

Many of us have experienced feelings of sadness or anxiety. In those moments of loneliness, we all need friendly support. Someone to help us see past the dark cloud in our minds, check in on us, and point us towards helpful resources, that too free of cost and from the comforts of our homes.
